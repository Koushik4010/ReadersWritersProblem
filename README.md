# ReadersWritersProblem
## Problem Statement
Write starvation free pseudo code for the classical readers-writers problem.

## Starvation free solution
The simple solution for starvation free readers writers problem is using the priority queue. By using the FIFO(First In First Out) priority queue we can ensure that all the requests are made available to resources in the order of arrival which in turn removes starvation of a particular process.  
Â 
**Pseudocode:**
```
semaphore orderQueue;   //requests are preserved in order of arrival uses FIFO priority
semaphore accessResource;   //Mutual exclusion of reading and writing processes
semaphore readersMutex;   //Prevents race condition while readcount is updating

//All the above semaphores are intialised to 1

int readcount=0;   //Keep track of number of readers


Readers Process:

wait(orderQueue); //wait untill all the process arrived first are completed

wait(readersMutex);  //avoid the entering of other readers while updating the readcount
if(readcount==0){
    wait(accessResource); //access of the shared resource by readers, and the writers are blocked from accessing
}
readcount++;  //Updating the number of readers
signal(readersMutex);
signal(orderQueue);  //signal the processes that are in the waiting queue to execute

   //Reading is performed  by accessing the shared resource

wait(readersMutex);
readcount--;
if(readcount==0){
     signal(accessResource);  //signaling the writers to access the shared resource
}
signal(readersMutex);



Writers Process:

wait(orderQueue);  //wait untill all the process arrived first are completed
wait(accessResource);  //access of the shared resource by readers, and the writers are blocked from accessing

     //Writing is performed by accessing the shared resource
     
signal(orderQueue);
signal(accessResource);  //signaling the readers to access the shared resource
```
**Semaphores Used:** 
- `orderQueue` : requests are preserved in order of arrival uses FIFO priority. 
- `accessResource` : Mutual exclusion of reading and writing processes.  
- `readersMutex` : Prevents race condition while readcount is updating.

**Variables Used:** 
- `readcount` : keep track of number of readers.
